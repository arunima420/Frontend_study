<p><a href="https://www.out.com/gay-tv-shows/noah-schnapp-gay-storyline-stranger-things" target="_self">Will Byers</a>, portrayed by Noah Schnapp, starts as a recurring but pivotal character in the first season of Stranger Things. 
    He is initially more of a 'treasure' that the adventuring party is trying to find, rather than a fully fleshed-out character. 
    However, from the second season onward, Will's character is promoted to the main cast, and his story is explored in more depth. 
    This includes his experiences in the Upside Down and his relationships with his friends and family.
     His character evolution is marked by his courage to open up about his feelings,
     especially to those he cares about the most.</p>

    from a typical teen to a tenacious investigator, aspiring journalist, and fearless fighter against the Upside Down,
